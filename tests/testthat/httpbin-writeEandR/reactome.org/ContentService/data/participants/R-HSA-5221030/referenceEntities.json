            "FUNCTION DNA glycosylase that plays a key role in active DNA demethylation: specifically recognizes and binds 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) in the context of CpG sites and mediates their excision through base-excision repair (BER) to install an unmethylated cytosine. Cannot remove 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). According to an alternative model, involved in DNA demethylation by mediating DNA glycolase activity toward 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) produced by deamination of 5hmC. Also involved in DNA repair by acting as a thymine-DNA glycosylase that mediates correction of G/T mispairs to G/C pairs: in the DNA of higher eukaryotes, hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine leads to the formation of G/T mismatches. Its role in the repair of canonical base damage is however minor compared to its role in DNA demethylation. It is capable of hydrolyzing the carbon-nitrogen bond between the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA and a mispaired thymine. In addition to the G/T, it can remove thymine also from C/T and T/T mispairs in the order G/T &gt;&gt; C/T &gt; T/T. It has no detectable activity on apyrimidinic sites and does not catalyze the removal of thymine from A/T pairs or from single-stranded DNA. It can also remove uracil and 5-bromouracil from mispairs with guanine.SUBUNIT Homodimer.

            "FUNCTION Dioxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of the modified genomic base 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and plays a key role in active DNA demethylation. Also mediates subsequent conversion of 5hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and conversion of 5fC to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Conversion of 5mC into 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC probably constitutes the first step in cytosine demethylation. Methylation at the C5 position of cytosine bases is an epigenetic modification of the mammalian genome which plays an important role in transcriptional regulation. In addition to its role in DNA demethylation, plays a more general role in chromatin regulation. Preferentially binds to CpG-rich sequences at promoters of both transcriptionally active and Polycomb-repressed genes. Involved in the recruitment of the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT to CpG-rich transcription start sites of active genes, thereby promoting histone H2B GlcNAcylation by OGT. Also involved in transcription repression of a subset of genes through recruitment of transcriptional repressors to promoters. Involved in the balance between pluripotency and lineage commitment of cells it plays a role in embryonic stem cells maintenance and inner cell mass cell specification. Plays an important role in the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. TET1-mediated production of 5hmC acts as a recruitment signal for the CHTOP-methylosome complex to selective sites on the chromosome, where it methylates H4R3 and activates the transcription of genes involved in glioblastomagenesis (PubMed:25284789). Binds preferentially to DNA containing cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) dinucleotides over CpH (H=A, T, and C), hemimethylated-CpG and hemimethylated-hydroxymethyl-CpG (PubMed:29276034).SUBUNIT Interacts with HCFC1 and OGT (By similarity). Interacts with SIN3A; recruits the transcriptional corepressor SIN3A to gene promoters (PubMed:21490601). Found in a complex composed of at least SINHCAF, SIN3A, HDAC1, SAP30, RBBP4, OGT and TET1 (By similarity).TISSUE SPECIFICITY Expressed in fetal heart, lung and brain, and in adult skeletal muscle, thymus and ovary. Not detected in adult heart, lung or brain. Up-regulated in glioblastoma cells (at protein level) (PubMed:25284789).DOMAIN The CXXC zinc finger mediates binding to CpG-DNA.PTM Glycosylated. Interaction with OGT leads to GlcNAcylation (By similarity).DISEASE A chromosomal aberration involving TET1 may be a cause of acute leukemias (PubMed:12646957). Translocation t(10;11)(q22;q23) with KMT2A/MLL1. This is a rare chromosomal translocation 5' KMT2A/MLL1-TET1 3' (PubMed:12124344, PubMed:12646957).SIMILARITY Belongs to the TET family.CAUTION Subsequent steps in cytosine demethylation are subject to discussion. According to a first model cytosine demethylation occurs through deamination of 5hmC into 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) and subsequent replacement by unmethylated cytosine by the base excision repair system (PubMed:21496894). According to another model, cytosine demethylation is rather mediated via conversion of 5hmC into 5fC and 5caC, followed by excision by TDG and replacement by unmethylated cytosine."

            "FUNCTION Dioxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of the modified genomic base 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and plays a key role in active DNA demethylation. Has a preference for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in CpG motifs. Also mediates subsequent conversion of 5hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and conversion of 5fC to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Conversion of 5mC into 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC probably constitutes the first step in cytosine demethylation. Methylation at the C5 position of cytosine bases is an epigenetic modification of the mammalian genome which plays an important role in transcriptional regulation. In addition to its role in DNA demethylation, also involved in the recruitment of the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT to CpG-rich transcription start sites of active genes, thereby promoting histone H2B GlcNAcylation by OGT.SUBUNIT Interacts with HCFC1 and OGT.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Broadly expressed. Highly expressed in hematopoietic cells; highest expression observed in granulocytes. Expression is reduced in granulocytes from peripheral blood of patients affected by myelodysplastic syndromes.PTM May be glycosylated. It is unclear whether interaction with OGT leads to GlcNAcylation. According to a report, it is not GlcNAcylated by OGT (PubMed:23353889). In contrast, another group reports GlcNAcylation by OGT in mouse ortholog.DISEASE TET2 is frequently mutated in myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). These constitute a heterogeneous group of disorders, also known as myeloproliferative diseases or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), characterized by cellular proliferation of one or more hematologic cell lines in the peripheral blood, distinct from acute leukemia. Included diseases are: essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis (chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis). Bone marrow samples from patients display uniformly low levels of hmC in genomic DNA compared to bone marrow samples from healthy controls as well as hypomethylation relative to controls at the majority of differentially methylated CpG sites.DISEASE TET2 is frequently mutated in systemic mastocytosis; also known as systemic mast cell disease. A condition with features in common with myeloproliferative diseases. It is a clonal disorder of the mast cell and its precursor cells. The clinical symptoms and signs of systemic mastocytosis are due to accumulation of clonally derived mast cells in different tissues, including bone marrow, skin, the gastrointestinal tract, the liver, and the spleen.SIMILARITY Belongs to the TET family.CAUTION Subsequent steps in cytosine demethylation are subject to discussion. According to a first model cytosine demethylation occurs through deamination of 5hmC into 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) and subsequent replacement by unmethylated cytosine by the base excision repair system.

Also mediates subsequent conversion of 5hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and conversion of 5fC to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Conversion of 5mC into 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC probably constitutes the first step in cytosine demethylation (By similarity). Selectively binds to the promoter region of target genes and contributes to regulate the expression of numerous developmental genes (PubMed:23217707). In zygotes, DNA demethylation occurs selectively in the paternal pronucleus before the first cell division, while the adjacent maternal pronucleus and certain paternally-imprinted loci are protected from this process. Participates in DNA demethylation in the paternal pronucleus by mediating conversion of 5mC into 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC. Does not mediate DNA demethylation of maternal pronucleus because of the presence of DPPA3/PGC7 on maternal chromatin that prevents TET3-binding to chromatin (By similarity).
