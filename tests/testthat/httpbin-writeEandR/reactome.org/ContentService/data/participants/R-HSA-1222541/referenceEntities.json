            "FUNCTION Component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO(2).FUNCTION Together with AhpC, AhpD and Lpd, constitutes an NADH-dependent peroxidase active against hydrogen and alkyl peroxides as well as serving as a peroxynitrite reductase, thus protecting the bacterium against reactive nitrogen intermediates and oxidative stress generated by the host immune system.FUNCTION Appears to be essential for Mtb pathogenesis.ACTIVITY REGULATION Inhibited by rhodanine compounds. Some of them almost exclusively kill non-replicating mycobacteria in synergy with products of host immunity, such as nitric oxide and hypoxia, and are effective on bacteria within macrophages.SUBUNIT Forms a 24-polypeptide structural core with octahedral symmetry (By similarity). Identified in a complex with AhpC, AhpD and Lpd. Part of the PDH complex, consisting of multiple copies of AceE (E1), DlaT (E2) and Lpd (E3).DISRUPTION PHENOTYPE Cells lacking this gene show severely retarded growth in vitro, and display no PDH activity. They are also more sensitive to nitrosative stress caused by NaNO(2), and to macrophage-induced killing in vitro. They also show at least 20-fold reduction in survival in a mouse tuberculosis model, and are unable to cause disease in a guinea pig model of tuberculosis infection. Disruption of dlaT leads to high up-regulation of the expression of the bkdABC operon.MISCELLANEOUS Is the only lipoylated protein in strain H37Rv grown on a standard rich medium. However, in a DlaT-deficient strain, another protein, BkdC, becomes lipoylated.SIMILARITY Belongs to the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase family."

            "FUNCTION Thiol-specific peroxidase that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols, respectively. Plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides. Together with AhpD, DlaT and Lpd, constitutes an NADH-dependent peroxidase active against hydrogen and alkyl peroxides as well as serving as a peroxynitrite reductase, thus protecting the bacterium against reactive nitrogen intermediates and oxidative stress generated by the host immune system. Does not however seem to play a role in detoxification of isoniazid.SUBUNIT Homodimer; disulfide-linked, upon oxidation. 6 homodimers assemble to form a ring-like dodecamer (PubMed:11171096, PubMed:15886207). Identified in a complex with AhpD, DlaT and Lpd (PubMed:11799204).INDUCTION Induced in isoniazid (INH)-resistant, KatG-deficient strains as well as in INH-sensitive strains when challenged with the drug. Increased expression in these strains probably compensates for loss of katG activity in detoxification of organic peroxides. A possible member of the dormancy regulon. Induced in response to reduced oxygen tension (hypoxia). It is hoped that this regulon will give insight into the latent, or dormant phase of infection.MISCELLANEOUS The active site is a conserved redox-active cysteine residue, the peroxidatic cysteine (C(P)), which makes the nucleophilic attack on the peroxide substrate. The peroxide oxidizes the C(P)-SH to cysteine sulfenic acid (C(P)-SOH), which then reacts with another cysteine residue, the resolving cysteine (C(R)), to form a disulfide bridge. The disulfide is subsequently reduced by an appropriate electron donor to complete the catalytic cycle. In this typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, C(R) is provided by the other dimeric subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide (PubMed:15178486, PubMed:15886207). The disulfide can subsequently be reduced through a mixed disulfide with the C-terminal cysteine of AhpD, resolved by its second cysteine (PubMed:15178486) or by thioredoxin (TrxC) (PubMed:14871480).SIMILARITY Belongs to the peroxiredoxin family.

            "FUNCTION Catalyzes the coenzyme F420-dependent oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone (PubMed:18434308). Appears to have a role in resistance to oxidative stress, via its consumption of G6P that serves as a source of reducing power to combat oxidative stress in mycobacteria. More precisely, is likely involved in a F420-dependent anti-oxidant mechanism that protects M.tuberculosis against oxidative stress and bactericidal agents (PubMed:23240649).FUNCTION Is essential for the bioreductive activation of the bicyclic 4-nitroimidazole prodrug PA-824 (a nitroimidazo-oxazine) developed for anti-tuberculosis therapy against both replicating and persistent bacteria. It does not interact directly with PA-824 but, rather, provides reduced F420 to the deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase Ddn, which in turn activates PA-824.ACTIVITY REGULATION Inhibited by citrate.SUBUNIT Homodimer.DISRUPTION PHENOTYPE Cells lacking this gene display a strong resistance to PA-824 and CGI-17341 (a nitroimidazo-oxazole).SIMILARITY Belongs to the F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase family."

            "FUNCTION Lipoamide dehydrogenase is an essential component of the alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes, namely the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKADH) complex, and likely also the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (ODH) complex. Catalyzes the reoxidation of dihydrolipoyl groups which are covalently attached to the lipoate acyltransferase components (E2) of the complexes. Is also able to catalyze the transhydrogenation of NADH and thio-NAD(+) in the absence of D,L-lipoamide, and the NADH-dependent reduction of quinones in vitro.FUNCTION Together with AhpC, AhpD and DlaT, Lpd constitutes an NADH-dependent peroxidase active against hydrogen and alkyl peroxides as well as serving as a peroxynitrite reductase, thus protecting the bacterium against reactive nitrogen intermediates and oxidative stress generated by the host immune system.FUNCTION Appears to be essential for Mtb pathogenesis.ACTIVITY REGULATION Triazaspirodimethoxybenzoyls are high-nanomolar inhibitors of M.tuberculosis Lpd and are non-competitive versus NADH, NAD(+), and lipoamide and &gt;100-fold selective compared to human Lpd.SUBUNIT Homodimer. Identified in a complex with AhpC, AhpD and DlaT. Also is part of the PDH complex, consisting of multiple copies of AceE (E1), DlaT (E2) and Lpd (E3), and of the BCKADH complex, consisting of multiple copies of BkdA/BkdB (E1), BkdC (E2) and Lpd (E3).DISRUPTION PHENOTYPE Cells lacking this gene grow, albeit poorly, in standard medium with dextrose, glycerol, and fatty acids as carbon sources, but fail to grow on carbohydrates. They are less resistant than wild-type to exposition to mildly acidified nitrite, but are more resistant to oxidative stress in the form of H(2)O(2) in vitro. Lpd-deficient strains are severely attenuated in wild-type and immunodeficient mice. In contrast to wild-type or DlaT lacking strains, strains lacking Lpd are unable to grow on leucine or isoleucine. Disruption of this gene also leads to extraordinary accumulations of pyruvate and branched chain amino and keto acids.MISCELLANEOUS The active site is a redox-active disulfide bond.SIMILARITY Belongs to the class-I pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family."
