            "FUNCTION Bifunctional enzyme with both catalase and broad-spectrum peroxidase activity, oxidizing various electron donors including NADP(H) (PubMed:9006925, PubMed:18178143). Protects M.tuberculosis against toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydrogen peroxide as well as organic peroxides and thus contributes to its survival within host macrophages by countering the phagocyte oxidative burst (PubMed:8658136, PubMed:15165233). Also displays efficient peroxynitritase activity, which may help the bacterium to persist in macrophages (PubMed:10080924).FUNCTION Might be involved in DNA repair. Partly complements recA-deficient E.coli cells exposed to UV radiation, mitomycin C or hydrogen peroxide. Increases resistance to mitomycin C in E.coli cells deficient for either uvrA, uvrB or uvrC.FUNCTION Catalyzes the oxidative activation of the antitubercular pro-drug isoniazid (INH) to generate an isonicotinoyl radical that then reacts nonenzymatically with NAD to form an isonicotinoyl-NAD adduct which inhibits InhA.SUBUNIT Homodimer.INDUCTION By treatment with H(2)O(2) (PubMed:8658136). Repressed by FurA (PubMed:11401695).DOMAIN Consists of two related domains. The catalase-peroxidase activity is associated with the N-terminal domain but no definite function has been assigned to the C-terminal domain, although it may play a role in substrate binding.PTM Formation of the three residue Trp-Tyr-Met cross-link is important for the catalase, but not the peroxidase activity of the enzyme (By similarity). The formation of the Trp-Tyr-Met cross-link is autocatalytic (PubMed:15840564).DISRUPTION PHENOTYPE Cells lacking this gene are devoid of catalase activity, supersensitive to H(2)O(2) exposure and highly resistant to the antitubercular drug isoniazid (INH) in vitro. This mutant strain is markedly attenuated for virulence in mice and displays impaired growth in infected macrophages, but its growth and survival is indistinguishable from wild-type in macrophages lacking the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase (Phox).MISCELLANEOUS In contrast to the Synechocystis sp. enzyme, no Trp radical is formed on the distal Trp residue (Trp-91).MISCELLANEOUS Was identified as a high-confidence drug target.MISCELLANEOUS Many isoniazid-resistant clinical isolates contain mutations in katG, leading to abolition or reduction of catalase/peroxidase activity which results in lack of INH activation, or to a reduced affinity for INH. Other mechanisms of INH resistance include deletion of the katG gene, and down-regulation of katG expression due to mutations in the furA-katG intergenic region.SIMILARITY Belongs to the peroxidase family. Peroxidase/catalase subfamily."

            "FUNCTION Thiol-specific peroxidase that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols, respectively. Plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides. Together with AhpD, DlaT and Lpd, constitutes an NADH-dependent peroxidase active against hydrogen and alkyl peroxides as well as serving as a peroxynitrite reductase, thus protecting the bacterium against reactive nitrogen intermediates and oxidative stress generated by the host immune system. Does not however seem to play a role in detoxification of isoniazid.SUBUNIT Homodimer; disulfide-linked, upon oxidation. 6 homodimers assemble to form a ring-like dodecamer (PubMed:11171096, PubMed:15886207). Identified in a complex with AhpD, DlaT and Lpd (PubMed:11799204).INDUCTION Induced in isoniazid (INH)-resistant, KatG-deficient strains as well as in INH-sensitive strains when challenged with the drug. Increased expression in these strains probably compensates for loss of katG activity in detoxification of organic peroxides. A possible member of the dormancy regulon. Induced in response to reduced oxygen tension (hypoxia). It is hoped that this regulon will give insight into the latent, or dormant phase of infection.MISCELLANEOUS The active site is a conserved redox-active cysteine residue, the peroxidatic cysteine (C(P)), which makes the nucleophilic attack on the peroxide substrate. The peroxide oxidizes the C(P)-SH to cysteine sulfenic acid (C(P)-SOH), which then reacts with another cysteine residue, the resolving cysteine (C(R)), to form a disulfide bridge. The disulfide is subsequently reduced by an appropriate electron donor to complete the catalytic cycle. In this typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, C(R) is provided by the other dimeric subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide (PubMed:15178486, PubMed:15886207). The disulfide can subsequently be reduced through a mixed disulfide with the C-terminal cysteine of AhpD, resolved by its second cysteine (PubMed:15178486) or by thioredoxin (TrxC) (PubMed:14871480).SIMILARITY Belongs to the peroxiredoxin family.
