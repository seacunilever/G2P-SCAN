            "FUNCTION Packages the positive strand viral genome RNA into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) and plays a fundamental role during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and membrane protein M. Plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral RNA transcription as well as viral replication (PubMed:17210170). May modulate transforming growth factor-beta signaling by binding host SMAD3 (PubMed:18055455).SUBUNIT Homooligomer. Both monomeric and oligomeric forms interact with RNA. Interacts with protein M (PubMed:15351485). Interacts with protein E (PubMed:24766657). May bind to host HNRNPA1 (Probable). Interacts with NSP3; this interaction serves to tether the genome to the newly translated replicase-transcriptase complex at a very early stage of infection (By similarity). May interact with host SMAD3 (Probable). Interacts with host PPIA/CYPA (PubMed:15688292).PTM ADP-ribosylated. The ADP-ribosylation is retained in the virion during infection.PTM Phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues (By similarity). Phosphorylated by host GSK3A and GSK3B. Phosphorylation allows recruitment of host RNA helicase DDX1 which facilitates template readthrough and enables longer subgenomic mRNA synthesis.SIMILARITY Belongs to the betacoronavirus nucleocapsid protein family."

            "SUBUNIT Homotrimer; each monomer consists of a S1 and a S2 subunit. The resulting peplomers protrude from the virus surface as spikes (By similarity). Binds to human and palm civet ACE2 and human CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR. Interacts with the accessory proteins 3a and 7a.DOMAIN The KxHxx motif seems to function as an ER retrieval and binds COPI in vitro.DOMAIN Fusion peptide 1 (FP1) and fusion peptide 2 (FP2) function cooperatively and have a membrane-ordering effect on lipid headgroups and shallow hydrophobic regions of target bilayers. They are considered as two domains of an extended, bipartite FP. The membrane-ordering activity is calcium-dependent and also dependent on correct folding, which is maintained by an internal disulfide bond in FP2.PTM The cytoplasmic Cys-rich domain is palmitoylated. Spike glycoprotein is digested by cathepsin CTSL within endosomes.PTM Specific enzymatic cleavages in vivo yield mature proteins. The precursor is processed into S1 and S2 by host cell furin or another cellular protease to yield the mature S1 and S2 proteins. Additionally, a second cleavage leads to the release of a fusion peptide after viral attachment to host cell receptor.PTM The cytoplasmic Cys-rich domain is palmitoylated. Spike glycoprotein is digested within host endosomes.MISCELLANEOUS Tor2 is the prototype of the virus isolated during the severe SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. GD03 has been isolated from the second mild SARS outbreak in winter 2003-2004. SZ3 has been isolated from palm civet, the presumed animal reservoir. The spike proteins from those three isolates display a strong affinity for palm civet ACE2 receptor, whereas only the Tor2 spike protein efficiently binds human ACE2. This may explain the high pathogenicity of Tor2 virus, whose spike is highly adapted to the human host. Therefore, the lack of severity of disease during the 2003-2004 outbreak could be due to the incomplete adaptation of GD03 virus to bind human ACE2. Mutation Asn-479 and Thr-487 in palm civet coronavirus seems necessary and sufficient for the virus to acquire the ability to efficiently infect humans.SIMILARITY Belongs to the betacoronaviruses spike protein family."
