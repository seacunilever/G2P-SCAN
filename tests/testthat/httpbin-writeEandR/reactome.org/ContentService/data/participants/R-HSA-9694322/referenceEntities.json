            "DOMAIN The KxHxx motif seems to function as an ER retrieval and binds COPI in vitro.DOMAIN Fusion peptide 1 (FP1) and fusion peptide 2 (FP2) function cooperatively and have a membrane-ordering effect on lipid headgroups and shallow hydrophobic regions of target bilayers. They are considered as two domains of an extended, bipartite FP. The membrane-ordering activity is calcium-dependent and also dependent on correct folding, which is maintained by an internal disulfide bond in FP2.PTM The cytoplasmic Cys-rich domain is palmitoylated. Spike glycoprotein is digested within host endosomes.PTM Specific enzymatic cleavages in vivo yield mature proteins. The precursor is processed into S1 and S2 by host CTSL, TMPRSS2 or furin to yield the mature S1 and S2 proteins (PubMed:32155444). CTSL cleavage would occur in endosomes (PubMed:32221306, PubMed:33465165). TMPRSS2 cleavage would occur at the cell surface, allowing the virus to enter the cell despite inhibition of the endosomal pathway by hydroxychloroquine (PubMed:33465165). In addition, a second cleavage results in the release of a fusion peptide upon viral binding to the host cell receptor (By similarity). The polybasic furin cleavage site is absent in SARS-CoV S (PubMed:32155444, PubMed:32362314, PubMed:33465165). It increases the dependence on TMPRSS2 expression by SARS-CoV-2 (PubMed:33465165).PTM Highly decorated by heterogeneous N-linked glycans protruding from the trimer surface (PubMed:32075877, PubMed:32155444, PubMed:32929138). Highly glycosylated by host both on S1 and S2 subunits, occluding many regions across the surface of the protein (PubMed:32366695, PubMed:32363391, PubMed:32929138). Approximately 40% of the protein surface is shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the notable exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain (PubMed:32929138).POLYMORPHISM Variant B.1.1.7 belongs to a lineage isolated first in United Kingdom (Dec 2020). It is also called Variant Of Concern (VOC) 202012/01, Variant Under Investigation (VUI) 202012/01, 501Y.V1 or 20B/501Y.V1.POLYMORPHISM Variant 501Y.V2 belongs to a lineage first isolated in South Africa (Dec 2020) is also called B 1.351.MISCELLANEOUS Variant D614G has become the most prevalent circulating sequence in the global pandemic since april 2020 (PubMed:32697968). The mutation is associated with higher viral loads produced in cell culture and animal models (PubMed:32697968, PubMed:33106671, PubMed:33184236). It would not change pathogenicity nor neutralization properties vs vaccination (PubMed:33184236). May be prevalent because the mutation increases virus transmission in human population (PubMed:33106671).SIMILARITY Belongs to the betacoronaviruses spike protein family.CAUTION Asn-17, Asn-603, Asn-1134, Asn-1158, and Asn-1173 are non glycosylated when S1 or S2 are expressed individually in HEK293 cells."
