            "FUNCTION Serine/threonine-protein kinase that performs several important functions throughout M phase of the cell cycle, including the regulation of centrosome maturation and spindle assembly, the removal of cohesins from chromosome arms, the inactivation of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) inhibitors, and the regulation of mitotic exit and cytokinesis. Polo-like kinase proteins acts by binding and phosphorylating proteins are that already phosphorylated on a specific motif recognized by the POLO box domains. Phosphorylates BORA, BUB1B/BUBR1, CCNB1, CDC25C, CEP55, ECT2, ERCC6L, FBXO5/EMI1, FOXM1, KIF20A/MKLP2, CENPU, NEDD1, NINL, NPM1, NUDC, PKMYT1/MYT1, KIZ, PPP1R12A/MYPT1, PRC1, RACGAP1/CYK4, SGO1, STAG2/SA2, TEX14, TOPORS, p73/TP73, TPT1, WEE1 and HNRNPU. Plays a key role in centrosome functions and the assembly of bipolar spindles by phosphorylating KIZ, NEDD1 and NINL. NEDD1 phosphorylation promotes subsequent targeting of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC) to the centrosome, an important step for spindle formation. Phosphorylation of NINL component of the centrosome leads to NINL dissociation from other centrosomal proteins. Involved in mitosis exit and cytokinesis by phosphorylating CEP55, ECT2, KIF20A/MKLP2, CENPU, PRC1 and RACGAP1. Recruited at the central spindle by phosphorylating and docking PRC1 and KIF20A/MKLP2; creates its own docking sites on PRC1 and KIF20A/MKLP2 by mediating phosphorylation of sites subsequently recognized by the POLO box domains. Phosphorylates RACGAP1, thereby creating a docking site for the Rho GTP exchange factor ECT2 that is essential for the cleavage furrow formation. Promotes the central spindle recruitment of ECT2. Plays a central role in G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle by phosphorylating CCNB1, CDC25C, FOXM1, CENPU, PKMYT1/MYT1, PPP1R12A/MYPT1 and WEE1. Part of a regulatory circuit that promotes the activation of CDK1 by phosphorylating the positive regulator CDC25C and inhibiting the negative regulators WEE1 and PKMYT1/MYT1. Also acts by mediating phosphorylation of cyclin-B1 (CCNB1) on centrosomes in prophase. Phosphorylates FOXM1, a key mitotic transcription regulator, leading to enhance FOXM1 transcriptional activity. Involved in kinetochore functions and sister chromatid cohesion by phosphorylating BUB1B/BUBR1, FBXO5/EMI1 and STAG2/SA2. PLK1 is high on non-attached kinetochores suggesting a role of PLK1 in kinetochore attachment or in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) regulation. Required for kinetochore localization of BUB1B. Regulates the dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes by phosphorylating cohesin subunits such as STAG2/SA2. Phosphorylates SGO1: required for spindle pole localization of isoform 3 of SGO1 and plays a role in regulating its centriole cohesion function. Mediates phosphorylation of FBXO5/EMI1, a negative regulator of the APC/C complex during prophase, leading to FBXO5/EMI1 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Acts as a negative regulator of p53 family members: phosphorylates TOPORS, leading to inhibit the sumoylation of p53/TP53 and simultaneously enhance the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates the transactivation domain of the transcription factor p73/TP73, leading to inhibit p73/TP73-mediated transcriptional activation and pro-apoptotic functions. Phosphorylates BORA, and thereby promotes the degradation of BORA. Contributes to the regulation of AURKA function. Also required for recovery after DNA damage checkpoint and entry into mitosis. Phosphorylates MISP, leading to stabilization of cortical and astral microtubule attachments required for proper spindle positioning (PubMed:8991084, PubMed:11202906, PubMed:12207013, PubMed:12447691, PubMed:12524548, PubMed:12738781, PubMed:12852856, PubMed:12939256, PubMed:14532005, PubMed:14734534, PubMed:15070733, PubMed:15148369, PubMed:15469984, PubMed:16198290, PubMed:16247472, PubMed:16980960, PubMed:17081991, PubMed:17351640, PubMed:17376779, PubMed:17617734, PubMed:18174154, PubMed:18331714, PubMed:18418051, PubMed:18477460, PubMed:18521620, PubMed:18615013, PubMed:19160488, PubMed:19351716, PubMed:19468300, PubMed:19468302, PubMed:19473992, PubMed:19509060, PubMed:19597481, PubMed:23455478, PubMed:23509069). Together with MEIKIN, acts as a regulator of kinetochore function during meiosis I: required both for mono-orientation of kinetochores on sister chromosomes and protection of centromeric cohesin from separase-mediated cleavage (By similarity). Phosphorylates CEP68 and is required for its degradation (PubMed:25503564). Regulates nuclear envelope breakdown during prophase by phosphorylating DCTN1 resulting in its localization in the nuclear envelope (PubMed:20679239). Phosphorylates the heat shock transcription factor HSF1, promoting HSF1 nuclear translocation upon heat shock (PubMed:15661742). Phosphorylates HSF1 also in the early mitotic period; this phosphorylation regulates HSF1 localization to the spindle pole, the recruitment of the SCF(BTRC) ubiquitin ligase complex induicing HSF1 degradation, and hence mitotic progression (PubMed:18794143). Regulates mitotic progression by phosphorylating RIOK2 (PubMed:21880710).ACTIVITY REGULATION Activated by phosphorylation of Thr-210 by AURKA; phosphorylation by AURKA is enhanced by BORA. Once activated, activity is stimulated by binding target proteins. Binding of target proteins has no effect on the non-activated kinase. Several inhibitors targeting PLKs are currently in development and are under investigation in a growing number of clinical trials, such as BI 2536, an ATP-competitive PLK1 inhibitor or BI 6727, a dihydropteridinone that specifically inhibits the catalytic activity of PLK1.SUBUNIT Interacts with CEP170 and EVI5. Interacts and phosphorylates ERCC6L. Interacts with FAM29A. Interacts with SLX4/BTBD12 and TTDN1. Interacts with BUB1B. Interacts (via POLO-box domain) with the phosphorylated form of BUB1, CENPU and CDC25C. Interacts with isoform 3 of SGO1. Interacts with BORA, KIF2A and AURKA. Interacts with TOPORS and CYLD. Interacts with ECT2; the interaction is stimulated upon phosphorylation of ECT2 on 'Thr-444'. Interacts with PRC1. Interacts with KIF20A/MKLP2 (when phosphorylated), leading to the recruitment at the central spindle. Interacts (via POLO box domains) with PPP1R12A/MYPT1 (when previously phosphorylated by CDK1). Part of an astrin (SPAG5)-kinastrin (SKAP) complex containing KNSTRN, SPAG5, PLK1, DYNLL1 and SGO2. Interacts with BIRC6/bruce. Interacts with CDK1-phosphorylated FRY; this interaction occurs in mitotic cells, but not in interphase cells. FRY interaction facilitates AURKA-mediated PLK1 phosphorylation. Interacts with CDK1-phosphorylated DCTN6 during mitotic prometaphase; the interaction facilitates recruitment to kinetochores. Interacts with CEP68; the interaction phosphorylates CEP68 (PubMed:25503564). Interacts (via POLO-box domain) with DCTN1 (PubMed:20679239). Interacts with CEP20 in later G1, S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle; this interaction recruits PLK1 to centrosomes, a step required for S phase progression (PubMed:24018379). Interacts with HSF1; this interaction increases upon heat shock but does not modulate neither HSF1 homotrimerization nor DNA-binding activities (PubMed:15661742, PubMed:18794143). Interacts with HNRNPU; this interaction induces phosphorylation of HNRNPU in mitosis (PubMed:25986610). Interacts (via its N-terminus) to RIOK2 (PubMed:21880710). Interacts with KLHL22 (PubMed:24067371, PubMed:23455478).TISSUE SPECIFICITY Placenta and colon.DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE Accumulates to a maximum during the G2 and M phases, declines to a nearly undetectable level following mitosis and throughout G1 phase, and then begins to accumulate again during S phase.INDUCTION By growth-stimulating agents.DOMAIN The POLO box domains act as phosphopeptide-binding module that recognize and bind serine-[phosphothreonine/phosphoserine]-(proline/X) motifs. PLK1 recognizes and binds docking proteins that are already phosphorylated on these motifs, and then phosphorylates them. PLK1 can also create its own docking sites by mediating phosphorylation of serine-[phosphothreonine/phosphoserine]-(proline/X) motifs subsequently recognized by the POLO box domains.PTM Catalytic activity is enhanced by phosphorylation of Thr-210. Phosphorylation at Thr-210 is first detected on centrosomes in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, peaks in prometaphase and gradually disappears from centrosomes during anaphase. Dephosphorylation at Thr-210 at centrosomes is probably mediated by protein phosphatase 1C (PP1C), via interaction with PPP1R12A/MYPT1. Autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of Ser-137 may not be significant for the activation of PLK1 during mitosis, but may enhance catalytic activity during recovery after DNA damage checkpoint. Phosphorylated in vitro by STK10.PTM Ubiquitinated by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) in anaphase and following DNA damage, leading to its degradation by the proteasome. Ubiquitination is mediated via its interaction with FZR1/CDH1. Ubiquitination and subsequent degradation prevents entry into mitosis and is essential to maintain an efficient G2 DNA damage checkpoint. Monoubiquitination at Lys-492 by the BCR(KLHL22) ubiquitin ligase complex does not lead to degradation: it promotes PLK1 dissociation from phosphoreceptor proteins and subsequent removal from kinetochores, allowing silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and chromosome segregation.DISEASE Defects in PLK1 are associated with some cancers, such as gastric, thyroid or B-cell lymphomas. Expression is cancer increased in tumor tissues with a poor prognosis, suggesting a role in malignant transformations and carcinogenesis.SIMILARITY Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. Ser/Thr protein kinase family. CDC5/Polo subfamily."

            "FUNCTION Regulator of APC activity during mitotic and meiotic cell cycle (PubMed:17485488, PubMed:17234884, PubMed:17875940, PubMed:23708001, PubMed:23708605, PubMed:16921029). During mitotic cell cycle plays a role as both substrate and inhibitor of APC-FZR1 complex (PubMed:29875408, PubMed:17485488, PubMed:17234884, PubMed:17875940, PubMed:23708001, PubMed:23708605, PubMed:16921029). During G1 phase, plays a role as substrate of APC-FZR1 complex E3 ligase (PubMed:29875408). Then switches as an inhibitor of APC-FZR1 complex during S and G2 leading to cell-cycle commitment (PubMed:29875408). As APC inhibitor, prevents the degradation of APC substrates at multiple levels: by interacting with APC and blocking access of APC substrates to the D-box coreceptor, formed by FZR1 and ANAPC10; by suppressing ubiquitin ligation and chain elongation by APC by preventing the UBE2C and UBE2S activities (PubMed:23708605, PubMed:23708001, PubMed:16921029). Plays a role in genome integrity preservation by coordinating DNA replication with mitosis through APC inhibition in interphase to stabilize CCNA2 and GMNN in order to promote mitosis and prevent rereplication and DNA damage-induced cellular senescence (PubMed:17234884, PubMed:17485488, PubMed:17875940). During oocyte maturation, plays a role in meiosis through inactivation of APC-FZR1 complex. Inhibits APC through RPS6KA2 interaction that increases FBXO5 affiniy for CDC20 leading to the metaphase arrest of the second meiotic division before fertilization (By similarity). Controls entry into the first meiotic division through inactivation of APC-FZR1 complex (By similarity). Promotes migration and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (PubMed:29850565).PATHWAY Protein modification; protein ubiquitination.SUBUNIT Part of a SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box) protein ligase complex (By similarity). Interacts with BTRC; mediates proteolysis by the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex leading to activation of APC in late mitosis and subsequent mitotic progression (PubMed:12791267). Interacts with FZR1/CDH1 and the N-terminal substrate-binding domain of CDC20; prevents APC activation (PubMed:11988738). Also interacts with EVI5 which blocks its phosphorylation by PLK1 and prevents its subsequent binding to BTRC and degradation (PubMed:16439210). Interacts simultaneously with anaphase promoting complex (APC), through at least ANAPC2, CDC23, CDC27, the APC substrate GMNN and the APC activator FZR1 (PubMed:23708001, PubMed:26083744). Interacts with UBE2S; interferes with the activity of UBE2S mainly by disrupting the dynamic electrostatic association between the C-terminal tail of UBE2S and ANAPC2 (PubMed:23708001). Interacts with RPS6KA2; cooperates to induce the metaphase arrest of early blastomeres; increases and stabilizes interaction of FBXO5 with CDC20 (By similarity).DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE Accumulates in late G1 phase, levels rise during S phase and drop in early mitosis.INDUCTION Up-regulated at 7 days after osteogenic induction (PubMed:29850565). Down-regulated in late G2 phase or mitosis (PubMed:17485488). Down-regulated in G2 phase after DNA damage in a CDKN1A-dependent manner (PubMed:19211842). Down-regulated in G1 phase when APC-FZR1 complex is active and accumulates at the G1-S transition, coincident with the inactivation of APC-FZR1 complex (PubMed:29875408). At the G1-S transition, transcriptionally induced by the E2F transcription factor (PubMed:11988738).PTM Phosphorylation by CDK2 and subsequently by PLK1 triggers degradation during early mitosis through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex containing the F-box protein BTRC. This degradation is necessary for the activation of APC in late mitosis and subsequent mitotic progression (PubMed:12791267, PubMed:15469984). Phosphorylated by RPS6KA2; increases and stabilizes interaction with CDC20 (By similarity).PTM Ubiquitinated by the SCF(BTRC) complex following phosphorylation by PLK1 (PubMed:15469984). Undergoes both 'Lys-11' and 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination by APC-FZR1 complex leading to degradation by proteasome during G1 phase (PubMed:29875408). Degraded through the SCF(BTRC) complex; degradation occurs during oocyte maturation, between germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and meiosis I, and is required for the meiosis I-meiosis II transition (By similarity)."
