            "FUNCTION Acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibits their ability to interact with cyclins D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein.SUBUNIT Heterodimer with CDK4 or CDK6. Predominant p16 complexes contained CDK6. Interacts with CDK4 (both 'T-172'-phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms); the interaction inhibits cyclin D-CDK4 kinase activity. Interacts with ISCO2.TISSUE SPECIFICITY Widely expressed but not detected in brain or skeletal muscle. Isoform 3 is pancreas-specific.PTM Phosphorylation seems to increase interaction with CDK4.DISEASE The association between cutaneous and uveal melanomas in some families suggests that mutations in CDKN2A may account for a proportion of uveal melanomas. However, CDKN2A mutations are rarely found in uveal melanoma patients.SIMILARITY Belongs to the CDKN2 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family.CAUTION The proteins described here are encoded by the gene CDKN2A, but are completely unrelated in terms of sequence and function to tumor suppressor ARF (AC Q8N726) which is encoded by the same gene."

            "FUNCTION Ser/Thr-kinase component of cyclin D-CDK4 (DC) complexes that phosphorylate and inhibit members of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family including RB1 and regulate the cell-cycle during G(1)/S transition. Phosphorylation of RB1 allows dissociation of the transcription factor E2F from the RB/E2F complexes and the subsequent transcription of E2F target genes which are responsible for the progression through the G(1) phase. Hypophosphorylates RB1 in early G(1) phase. Cyclin D-CDK4 complexes are major integrators of various mitogenenic and antimitogenic signals. Also phosphorylates SMAD3 in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and represses its transcriptional activity. Component of the ternary complex, cyclin D/CDK4/CDKN1B, required for nuclear translocation and activity of the cyclin D-CDK4 complex.ACTIVITY REGULATION Both phosphorylation at Thr-172 and binding of a D-type cyclin are necessary for enzymatic activity. Full activation of the cyclin-D-CDK4 complex appears to require other factors such as recruitment of the substrate via a substrate recruitment motif, and/or formation of the CDKN1B ternary complex. Inhibited by INK4 family members. In resting cells, the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated form of CDKN1B prevents phosphorylation at Thr-172 and inactivation, while, in proliferating cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of CDKN1B allows phosphorylation of Thr-172 of CDK4 and subsequent activation.SUBUNIT Component of the D-CDK4 complex, composed of CDK4 and some D-type G1 cyclin (CCND1, CCND2 or CCND3). Interacts directly in the complex with CCND1, CCND2 or CCND3. Interacts with SEI1 and ZNF655. Forms a ternary complex, cyclin D-CDK4-CDKN1B, involved in modulating CDK4 enzymatic activity. Interacts directly with CDKN1B (phosphorylated on 'Tyr-88' and 'Tyr-89'); the interaction allows assembly of the cyclin D-CDK4 complex, Thr-172 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and enhances the cyclin D-CDK4 complex activity. CDK4 activity is either inhibited or enhanced depending on stoichiometry of complex. The non-tyrosine-phosphorylated form of CDKN1B prevents T-loop phosphorylation of CDK4 producing inactive CDK4. Interacts (unphosphorylated form) with CDK2. Also forms ternary complexes with CDKN1A or CDKN2A. Interacts directly with CDKN1A (via its N-terminal); the interaction promotes the assembly of the cyclin D-CDK4 complex, its nuclear translocation and promotes the cyclin D-dependent enzyme activity of CDK4. Interacts with CCND1; the interaction is prevented with the binding of CCND1 to INSM1 during cell cycle progression. Probably forms a complex composed of chaperones HSP90 and HSP70, co-chaperones CDC37, PPP5C, TSC1 and client protein TSC2, CDK4, AKT, RAF1 and NR3C1; this complex does not contain co-chaperones STIP1/HOP and PTGES3/p23 (PubMed:29127155). Interacts with CEBPA (when phosphorylated) (PubMed:15107404). Interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (PubMed:27353360).PTM Phosphorylation at Thr-172 is required for enzymatic activity. Phosphorylated, in vitro, at this site by CCNH-CDK7, but, in vivo, appears to be phosphorylated by a proline-directed kinase. In the cyclin D-CDK4-CDKN1B complex, this phosphorylation and consequent CDK4 enzyme activity, is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of CDKN1B. Thus, in proliferating cells, CDK4 within the complex is phosphorylated on Thr-172 in the T-loop. In resting cells, phosphorylation on Thr-172 is prevented by the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated form of CDKN1B.SIMILARITY Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CMGC Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
